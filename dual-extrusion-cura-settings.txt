There are multiple ways to do multi extrusion. Most seem to reccomend start and end Gcode in extruder settings, but I don't like this approach.
Instead, you can get good results using just Cura's profile settings and the Printer Settings plugin.

Start by measuring the distance from the top of the Y joint to the nozzle.
Simplest way is to set the filament right at the beginning and extrude until it comes out the nozzle.
We'll call this "Parking Distance"

Set "Heat Zone Length" to your Parking Distance on both extruders
Make sure "Nozzle Switch Retraction Distance" is using the same setting
Tick "Extruders Share Heater"
Tick "Extruders Share Nozzle"

If you want to always start with both filemnts before the nozzle, set "Shared Nozzle Initial Retraction" to your Parking Distance on BOTH extruders.
If you want to start with Extruder 1 loaded and do a nozzle swipe, set "Shared Nozzle Initial Retraction" to 0 on the first extruder and Parking Distance on the other.
