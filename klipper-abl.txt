There is a Gcode macro in the printer.cfg for leveling the bed and saving it to a variable "ENDER5"
Run G29 from the octoprint terminal to probe the bed and save out the level to the config file
You can use: ```BED_MESH_PROFILE LOAD=ENDER5``` in slicing software or directly in Octoprint's Gcode Scripts to load the level.
